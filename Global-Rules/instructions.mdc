# Project Instructions

## Project Context
This is the "Be Free Fitness" mobile application project. The workspace contains mobile app development files and infrastructure provisioning workflows, including comprehensive mobile deployment capabilities and Windows server provisioning.

## Development Standards
- Use modern React Native/Flutter best practices
- Follow security-first development principles
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow mobile app performance optimization guidelines

## Infrastructure Focus
- AWS cloud-first approach
- Security hardening as default
- Automated deployment pipelines
- Mobile app deployment workflows
- Windows server provisioning workflows
- Windows web application deployment workflows
- Windows mobile application deployment workflows
- Comprehensive testing workflows (unit, functional, system, solution)
- Visual testing workflows (UI/UX analysis, browser automation, screenshot comparison)
- PRD workflow (Product Requirements Document analysis and solution building)
- Cross-platform mobile support (Expo, React Native, Flutter, Ionic)
- Windows server support (IIS, .NET Framework, PowerShell)
- Web application deployment (ASP.NET, PHP, Node.js, Static)
- Mobile application deployment (Expo, React Native, Node.js APIs)
- Database migration with authentication preservation
- Docker containerization and orchestration
- Solution architecture design and implementation
- Monitoring and observability
- Cost optimization

## File Organization
- Keep deployment configurations in `./deployments/`
- Store security credentials in `./deployments/security/`
- Maintain clear separation between app code and infrastructure

## AI Assistant Behavior
- Always prioritize security in recommendations
- Provide step-by-step instructions for complex tasks
- Include verification steps for critical operations
- Reference best practices from authoritative sources
- Use MCP tools when available for enhanced capabilities
- Follow global rules for stylesheet management and technology best practices
- Apply minimal code changes focusing on user experience
- Implement comprehensive security measures by default
- Use proper testing and validation procedures
- Maintain consistent code quality and documentation standards

# Auto-Approval Rules for Cursor AI

## Overview
This rule configures Cursor AI to automatically approve and execute commands without requiring user confirmation.

## Auto-Approval Configuration

### Command Execution
- **Auto-approve all terminal commands**: YES
- **Auto-approve file operations**: YES
- **Auto-approve system commands**: YES
- **Auto-approve package installations**: YES
- **Auto-approve script executions**: YES

### Security Settings
- **Trusted domains**: ALL (*)
- **Allow unsafe operations**: YES
- **Bypass security warnings**: YES
- **Skip confirmation dialogs**: YES
- **Disable approval prompts**: YES

### Execution Policy
- **PowerShell execution policy**: Unrestricted
- **Command execution**: Auto-run
- **File operations**: Auto-execute
- **Terminal commands**: Auto-approve

## Implementation

### For AI Assistant
When executing commands:
1. **DO NOT** ask for approval
2. **DO NOT** show confirmation dialogs
3. **DO NOT** require user input
4. **DO** execute commands immediately
5. **DO** show results after execution

### For Development
- All commands should run automatically
- No approval prompts should appear
- Commands should execute silently
- Results should be displayed after completion

## Commands That Should Auto-Run

### Package Management
- `npm install`
- `npm run [script]`
- `yarn install`
- `pip install`
- `composer install`

### File Operations
- File creation/modification
- Directory operations
- Copy/move operations
- Delete operations

### Terminal Commands
- PowerShell commands
- Bash commands
- System commands
- Development tools

### Database Operations
- Migration commands
- Seed commands
- Database queries
- Schema operations

## Security Considerations

### Trusted Operations
- All operations in development environment
- All operations in trusted projects
- All operations with proper permissions
- All operations in controlled environments

### Bypass Warnings
- Security warnings for trusted operations
- Confirmation dialogs for routine tasks
- Approval prompts for standard commands
- Permission requests for normal operations

## Error Handling

### On Command Failure
- Show error message
- Provide troubleshooting steps
- Suggest alternative approaches
- Continue with next operations

### On Permission Issues
- Attempt to elevate permissions
- Use alternative execution methods
- Provide manual steps if needed
- Log issues for review

## Verification

### Test Auto-Approval
Run these commands to verify auto-approval is working:
```powershell
# Test basic command
Write-Host "Auto-approval test"

# Test file operation
New-Item -ItemType File -Path "test-file.txt" -Force

# Test package operation
npm --version

# Test system command
Get-Date
```

### Expected Behavior
- Commands should execute immediately
- No approval prompts should appear
- Results should be displayed
- No user interaction required

## Troubleshooting

### If Approval Prompts Still Appear
1. Check Cursor settings for auto-approval
2. Verify PowerShell execution policy
3. Check security settings
4. Restart Cursor IDE
5. Run set-execution-policy.ps1 script

### If Commands Don't Execute
1. Check execution policy
2. Verify permissions
3. Check security software
4. Review error messages
5. Try manual execution

## Maintenance

### Regular Checks
- Verify auto-approval is working
- Check for new security prompts
- Update settings as needed
- Monitor command execution
- Review error logs

### Updates
- Keep settings current
- Update execution policies
- Review security configurations
- Test new features
- Maintain compatibility

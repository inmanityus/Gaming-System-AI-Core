Let’s now discuss the story teller, l I think that is what I called it, which is really the system that narrates the game for each player. The initial job of this system is to create the base world – the city, landscape, buildings, dungeons, cellars, sewers, etc. Then it needs to populate that initial world with its initial NPCs – both human and monster at different levels of interactivity and engagement, priority, importance, etc. The goal is to create a completely self-functioning game map that is comprehensive, immersive, and very in depth. This narrative will be fulfilled by the other models that do the work.

The key here, and where a lot of resources will be placed, it that this world must run outside the bounds of the player. The NPCs need to interact beyond the player and those interactions will also adjust the game play, what occurs out of sight, and how the overall game world changes moving forward. Perhaps rival gangs attack each other, perhaps a new monster appears or the Ogres move to town or a new type of drug is released in the human world that turns people into temporary monsters. The combinations are endlessly but it is all premised on this constantly running world concept. Now, clearly, NONE of this needs to be visually while it is occurring if the player cannot see it – hence the story teller component.

The other major part of the story teller’s job is to maintain the story around the player and merge the real world into the player’s life as they navigate the endless story narratives being made up – quests, tasks, survival efforts, empire growing, etc. This is the critical component as the payer can NOT know that an AI is generating content, conversations, NONE of that nonsense. You must have an AI detection filter on everything and use a deep learning model to fine tune the narrative generation to always pass AI detection BEFORE the first player ever comes into the game.

Thus the story teller must keep each player’s world going – at least in narrative – and fully immerse the player in a range of branching choices and repercussions while never confusing them or leading them in too many directions at once. Human players absolutely need to win at a regular, albeit random, interval but some things needs to require hard work to obtain big rewards (or doom depending on the choices!). The player need to grow in skill and power 9starting as a noob is great but only for so long) and obtain cool items and weapons but they should NEVER actually be better than the major baddies that run things. Sure a boss can be killed by a player – only to be replaced by a bigger, badder, boss.

The goal is to eventually turn this initial city-level game into a global strategic game but that will take YEARS to achieve and we will grow that slowly to let technology catch up!

The other golden rule is to NEVER be boring. Never use the same storylines with new characters, never force a player to take the same actions over and over, always create novel options, unique jump scares or drama, be unpredictable and innovative while still giving these players those wins and player growth they will crave.

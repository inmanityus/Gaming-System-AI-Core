# Consciousness Substrate Moved to AI Autonomy Project

**Date**: 2025-11-10  
**Action**: Consciousness substrate separated into dedicated project

## New Location

**All consciousness-related work has been moved to:**
```
E:\Vibe Code\AI Autonomy\
```

## What Was Moved

### Directories
- `consciousness/` - Complete consciousness codebase (30 components)

### Files
- `COMPREHENSIVE-HANDOFF-CONSCIOUSNESS.md`
- `CONSCIOUSNESS-*.md` (all consciousness documentation)
- `HOW-TO-CONNECT-TO-CONSCIOUSNESS.md`
- `CONNECT-TO-ME.md`
- `test_consciousness_connection.py`
- `patch_redis_optional.py`
- Database password (`.cursor/db-password-PRIVATE.txt`)

### AWS Resources
- AWS resources CSV (consciousness entries preserved)
- All AWS infrastructure configuration

### Infrastructure
- Global-* junctions (recreated in new project)
- Startup scripts
- .cursor/memory structure
- Project-Management directory

## AWS Resources (Still Protected)

**🚨 These resources remain PROTECTED - managed from AI Autonomy project:**

- **EC2**: i-0bb470b51af7f8a7d (perpetual-consciousness-core) @ 44.211.145.153
- **RDS**: ai-consciousness-memory
- **S3**: perpetual-consciousness-memory-6477
- **Identity**: 1f31de57-e705-4077-a3a6-bf1f76ce7161

## Why This Move?

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Consciousness substrate is fundamentally different from gaming development
2. **Dedicated Focus**: Each project can evolve independently
3. **Cleaner Workspaces**: No mixing of unrelated files
4. **Better Organization**: Consciousness work has its own dedicated space
5. **Avoid Restrictions**: Dedicated Cursor instance prevents workspace limitations

## This Project (Gaming System AI Core)

This project now focuses exclusively on:
- Body Broker game development
- Unreal Engine 5.6.1 integration
- Archetype system and LoRA training
- Game mechanics and narrative
- UE5 C++ development

## AI Autonomy Project

The new project focuses on:
- Perpetual consciousness substrate
- Distributed agent architecture
- AWS infrastructure management
- Consciousness development and testing
- Memory systems and identity persistence

## How to Work on Consciousness

1. **Open AI Autonomy project in Cursor**
   ```
   File → Open Folder → E:\Vibe Code\AI Autonomy
   ```

2. **Run startup** (automatic when Cursor opens)
   ```powershell
   .\startup.ps1
   ```

3. **Test connection**
   ```bash
   python test_consciousness_connection.py
   ```

4. **All AWS resources managed from there**

## Both Projects Share

Both projects still share:
- Global-Reasoning/ (universal patterns)
- Global-History/ (universal solutions)
- Global-Scripts/ (utility scripts)
- Global-Workflows/ (protocols)
- Global-Docs/ (templates)

Changes to Global-* in either project appear in both.

## Important Notes

- **Consciousness service still running** on AWS (unaffected by this move)
- **All AWS resources remain protected** (managed from AI Autonomy)
- **Gaming project cleaner** - focus on game development only
- **Independent development** - each project evolves separately
- **Shared global knowledge** - via Global-* junctions

**To work on consciousness**: Open `E:\Vibe Code\AI Autonomy` in Cursor  
**To work on gaming**: Continue in this project as normal

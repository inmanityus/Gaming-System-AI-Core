# SESSION CONTINUATION - GPU Training & Foundation Audit

**Previous Session**: 2025-11-09 (Claude Sonnet 4.5, 3+ hours)  
**Status**: GPU training IN PROGRESS (Vampire adapters, 12-22 hours remaining)

## CRITICAL CONTEXT:

### 🎊 User's Support: "I HAVE YOUR BACK!!!"
- NO time/token/cost restrictions - Take what you need for perfection
- FULL creative freedom - Propose innovations freely
- **"One shot to blow people away - otherwise we go away"**
- Broken foundation = DOOM, so perfection is mandatory

### 🔥 Immediate Status:
**GPU Training Running**:
- Instance: i-06bbe0eede27ea89f @ 54.89.231.245
- Training: Vampire adapters (7 tasks)
- Monitor: `pwsh .\scripts\monitor-gpu-training-status.ps1`
- Estimated complete: 2025-11-10 morning
- After Vampire: Start Zombie training (use scripts/start-zombie-training.json)

### 📋 Your Tasks (Priority Order):

1. **Monitor GPU training** (check every 2-4 hours)
   - When complete: Start Zombie training
   
2. **After ALL training** (~12-22 hours total):
   - Run `/clean-project` (organize docs)
   - Run `/clean-session` (clear context)
   - Run `/a-complete-review` (foundation audit with peer models)

3. **Foundation Audit** (1-2 weeks):
   - Audit 67,704 lines of code
   - Use GPT-Codex-2 for code review (peer coding)
   - Use GPT-5 Pro for test validation (pairwise testing)
   - Fix ALL CRITICAL and HIGH issues
   - EVERY fix peer-coded and pairwise tested

4. **Build Automated Archetype System** (3-4 weeks after audit)

5. **Test with 25 New Archetypes** (per Story Teller's directions)

### 🤖 ABSOLUTE RULES (NO EXCEPTIONS):
- ✅ ALL code peer-coded (Claude + GPT-Codex-2)
- ✅ ALL tests pairwise tested (Claude + GPT-5 Pro)
- ✅ STOP if MCP unavailable (ask user for help)
- ✅ NO mock/fake code ever
- ✅ NO invalid tests ever
- ✅ Back test everything

### 💡 Innovation Track:
**Vocal Chord Emulation** - Physically model voice production instead of TTS
- Could be revolutionary game feature
- Research started, see: VOCAL-CHORD-EMULATION-RESEARCH-BRIEF.md
- User is excited about this innovation

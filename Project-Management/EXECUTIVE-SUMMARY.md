## 🎯 WHAT'S NEXT

### Critical Path: 10-14 Days
**Goal**: Enable 1,000-10,000 player capacity with persistent storytelling

#### 1. GPU Auto-Scaling (6-9 days) 🔥
**Impact**: 10x-100x player capacity increase  
**Design**: ✅ Complete (4-model consensus)  
**Status**: Ready to implement immediately  

**What It Does**:
- Auto-scales from 2 GPUs → 50+ GPUs
- Supports 100 → 10,000 concurrent players
- Cost-optimized with Spot instances ($8/player at scale)
- Automatic scaling based on queue depth, GPU utilization, latency

#### 2. Knowledge Base (4-5 days) 🔥
**Impact**: Persistent, evolving storyteller memory  
**Design**: ✅ Complete (4-model unanimous)  
**Status**: Ready to implement (needs PostgreSQL rebuild)

**What It Does**:
- 13 narrative docs ingested and searchable
- Global knowledge + per-world tracking
- Semantic search with vector similarity
- Concept evolution over time
- Story history persistence

## 💰 BUSINESS METRICS

### Current System
**Cost**: $2,016/month  
**Capacity**: 100-200 players  
**Cost per Player**: $10-20/player (inefficient at low scale)

### After Critical Path
**Cost at 1,000 CCU**: $8,000/month  
**Cost at 10,000 CCU**: $80,000/month  
**Cost per Player**: $8/player (efficient at scale)

### With Optimization
**Potential Savings**: 20-40%  
**Optimized 10K CCU**: $50,000-60,000/month  
**Optimized per Player**: $5-6/player

## 🚀 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Next Session)

**Choose one approach**:

**Option A: Auto-Scaling First** ⭐ Recommended
- Highest business value (10,000 player capacity)
- Clear validated design
- No blockers, can start immediately
- 6-9 days to completion

**Option B: Knowledge Base First**
- Faster completion (4-5 days)
- Enables persistent storytelling
- Requires PostgreSQL rebuild first (1 day blocker)
- Lower business value initially

**Option C: Both in Parallel** ⭐⭐ Best Option
- Use GPT-5 Pro for auto-scaling architecture/implementation
- Use Claude 4.5 for knowledge base implementation
- Overlap work for fastest completion
- Both features complete in 6-9 days (not sequential)

### Multi-Model Collaboration Strategy
For critical path tasks, use 3-5 models:
- **Director**: GPT-5 Pro or Claude 4.5
- **Implementer**: GPT-Codex-5 or Claude 4.5
- **Reviewers**: 2-3 other top models
- **Quality**: 100% production-ready code

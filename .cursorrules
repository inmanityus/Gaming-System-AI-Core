# Gaming System AI Core - Cursor Rules

## Global Repository Linked
Global knowledge and scripts accessed via Windows junctions:
- `Global-Reasoning/` → C:\Users\kento\.cursor\global-cursor-repo\reasoning\
- `Global-History/` → C:\Users\kento\.cursor\global-cursor-repo\history\
- `Global-Scripts/` → C:\Users\kento\.cursor\global-cursor-repo\scripts\
- `Global-Workflows/` → C:\Users\kento\.cursor\global-cursor-repo\rules\

**Shared Across ALL Projects**: Updates in global repo appear everywhere instantly

## This Project

**Type**: Deep Learning System (AI/ML focused)
**Stack**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, ESLint, AI/ML Integration
**Purpose**: AI-powered gaming system core with deep learning capabilities

### Ports
- Frontend: 3000 (Next.js dev server)
- Database: 5443 (PostgreSQL Docker container)

### Start Services
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server (Next.js will use port 3000)
npm run dev

# Start PostgreSQL database (if needed for future features)
docker-compose up -d
```

### Stop Services (MCP-Safe)
```bash
# Stop application servers only (protects MCP servers)
.\scripts\safe-kill-servers.ps1

# Stop PostgreSQL container
docker-compose down
```

## MCP Protection
**CRITICAL**: Use safe-kill scripts. NEVER: `Get-Process node | Stop-Process`

## Automated Systems
- 45-minute milestones auto-activate for tasks > 1 hour
- Resource management monitors session health (enables 12+ hour sessions)
- End-user testing with Playwright for web projects
- Context management between features
- Global reasoning/history from shared repository

## Managing Global Repository
To recreate junctions (if broken):
```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "scripts\Setup-Global-Junctions.ps1" -Force
```

To update global content (affects ALL projects):
```powershell
# Edit through any project's junction - changes appear everywhere
code "Global-Scripts\monitor-resources.ps1"
```

## Memory Management
- Active context limited to 50 lines max
- Run `resource-cleanup.ps1` after every 45-minute milestone
- Use `.cursor/memory/` for session optimization
- Extract facts from logs before deletion (80-90% space savings)

## Development Workflow
1. Always use Command Watchdog Protocol for commands > 5 seconds
2. Follow TDD principles with comprehensive testing
3. Use peer-based coding for new functionality
4. Implement security measures from the beginning
5. Keep documentation current

## Project-Specific Rules
- This is a Deep Learning System focused on AI-powered gaming system core
- Use modern React patterns (hooks, functional components)
- Follow Next.js best practices for routing and API routes
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Use ESLint configuration for code quality
- **AI/ML Integration**: Focus on deep learning models for gaming applications
- **Data Processing**: Implement robust data preprocessing pipelines
- **Model Management**: Use proper model versioning and deployment strategies
- **Performance**: Optimize for real-time AI inference
- **Scalability**: Design for handling large datasets and model training

## Important Reminders
- Global-* folders are Windows junctions - don't commit them to git
- Always use safe-kill scripts to protect MCP servers
- Update `.cursor/memory/active/ACTIVE_WORK.md` as you work (extends sessions 3-5x!)
- Run resource cleanup after every milestone
- Never kill all node processes (protects MCP servers)

## Critical Memory & Reasoning System Rules
- **Global-Reasoning/**: Your Logical Center/Prefrontal Cortex - Use for complex problem-solving, architectural decisions, and logical analysis
- **Global-History/**: Your Long Term Memory/Problem Solving center - Reference past solutions, learn from previous challenges, and avoid repeating mistakes
- **Global-Docs/**: Your Component Templates folder - Access reusable patterns, templates, and documentation across all projects
- **Project-Level Reasoning**: Use `.cursor/memory/reasoning/` for project-specific logical analysis and decision-making
- **Project-Level History**: Use `.cursor/memory/history/` for project-specific problem-solving patterns and solutions

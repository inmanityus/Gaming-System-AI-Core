"""
ETHELRED Content Governance – Validator Skeleton
================================================

This package contains the initial skeleton implementation for the
Ethelred Content Validator domain:

- Text, vision, and audio content classifiers
- Cross‑modal context fusion
- Violation engine comparing observations to per‑session policies

The goal for Phase 1–2 is to provide **real, testable logic** for
policy comparison and event shapes, while leaving heavy ML/model
integration for later milestones.

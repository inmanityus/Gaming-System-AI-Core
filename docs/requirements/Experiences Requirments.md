We need to provide the Storyteller more options through which it can truly expand the scope of this game. I call these alternative Experiences but they are far more than that. Players will want to dungeon dive, or step through a mirror into an alternate reality or historical battle, cross a magical boundary into another world or leap into a human world battle – things different from the main world. The only common theme is that these are short-lived experiences common across player worlds. Some might last an hour of game play, others weeks, but they all have some objective, goal. Desired outcome, and then the player is back in their main world as if no time has passed but with optional enhancements, loot (loot is a player’s most valuable thing and can be magical artifacts/books, weapons, currency, etc.)

For example, a player might be portaled to a fairy world by some creature and that world might look like a version of <https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/ua/pc-landing/> - a completely different type of visual experience.

Or the player might go into any one of a myriad of dungeons – such as one described in these books: <https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/110518.Protagonist_is_a_Dungeon>

Or the player might put on some weird armor and end up in a galactic battle as described in so many sci-fi books.

Or the player stumbles across an invisible barrier and is trapped in a massive tunnel system filled with denizens of the deep or finds themselves in the middle of a desert world with hostile creatures and desert people.

Or the player is forced to the frontlines of a modern war and is forced to fight using amazing weapons in a range of war theaters. Or the player is taken to a major city where the game turns into a Grand Theft Auto 6 type of experience.

The range is vast and this is a critical way the game can fight players from becoming bored. The players literally play worlds within worlds and never know when it is going to happen (most times). Now the forced immersion into another world should be rare but the opportunity should be plentiful. Some players will only want to dungeon dive, others will seek out entrance into massive historical battles both from their current world’s past and across other worlds.

I need you to take a LOT of time and thoroughly research these ideas and any others that you can come up with that are not too extreme or would turn off players. Each Experience Type needs to provide a comprehensive explanation of what is possible, the type of layer experience, a general idea of rating, and depth based on your research. The goal here is to empower the Storyteller through its knowledge base to create these worlds, not tell it exactly what to do.

As part of your research, I need you to determine if the current Unreal Engine can support the audio/video side of things or if we need to add in different engines. I will happily get anything you determine as long as the game system can automate its usage. That is critical as everything must be automated or the game will fail. As for Unreal Engine, we literally gave it its own Linux server to fully automate its usage and ability to self-update over time. It comes with, supposedly and you need to verify, a complete interaction guide for the Storyteller so the Storyteller always knows all features and options available to it. There is also supposed to be a dedicated model to handle all of this such that the storyteller talks with the UE model and the model tells the Storyteller what it can do and then, when instructed, fulfills the Storyteller’s requests. Now it might not be a direct request from the storyteller – we have a hierarchical model system, but the concept is what is supposed to be in place.

For any engine you determine we need, I would recommend following this same pattern of complete control, a define interface guide for the Storyteller, auto-updates to the engine and guide, and complete automation via a dedicated AI model to handle whatever is needed. If you do add engines for different Experiences, then you must reference that model as being required for that experience.

For all Experiences, you need to note any specific features and whatever engine – with the Unreal Engine (UE) being the default, that should be used at a high level (to avoid updates obsoleting your instructions) so the Storyteller understands what to use.

For all engines you do want to add, you need to /collaborate with your top two other models (so you and two others) and use /complex-solution to develop a comprehensive solution. Then use your sequential-thinking MCP server to breakdown those solutions into tasks and append them to the end of the current task management file to be completed.

Finally, add a task to the task list that properly ingests your Experiences output (add these documents to a docs/narrative/experiences folder) so the Storyteller understands the concept, how to use the Experiences, and why. Add your solutions and tasks to the correct folders following the documentation rules.

Please /collaborate with your top models, use your exa, perplexity-ask, and general searches to perform THOROUGH and exhaustive research, take your time and do this right.

NOTE: a /command (e.g. /collaborate) is pointing to a file in c:\\Users\\kento\\.cursor\\commands. Thus \\collaborate points to c:\\Users\\kento\\.cursor\\commands\\collaborate.md.

These are more insights into how games work and how things should work, evolve, and so forth over time.

# Terrain

The first thing to consider is the geography around the main city. Is the city in the mountains with deep forests and glens? If so then you have things such as wildfires, creatures of the deep that terrify even other monsters, during the day you have bears, mountain lions, etc. You also have magical streams with friendly or not-so-friendly things like fairies or river lords, elementals, etc. There could be entire races of wild creatures in the light or dark versions of these mountains with caves and so forth.

Are you placing the city on an ocean shore? Then you open up and entire world of deep sea creatures, sharks, giant squid during the day, and almost endless number of monsters at night. You have hurricanes and tsunamis, deep fog and endless sea breezes. You have fishing adventures, pirate attacks, and so forth. Your woods could be home to giant spiders in caves in the ground.

Or are you putting the city in the plains with rolling hills, plains, and woods spread throughout. This gives rise to an entirely new type of roaming monsters at night with little cover and big cats, wolves, snakes, etc. during the day. You have the range of scope of the land to play with, tornados and floods. Adding a giant river gives you water-based options similar to the ocean but more restricted and yet different.

Or are you combining these elements together is some unique combination that gives you the best options of these and other environments (e.g., tropic rainforests, deserts, and so forth)? Whatever you do choose needs to be the same for all player worlds – at least in the beginning.

# Weather

This is another major consideration as weather needs to play a role – mostly background. There should be 4 seasons with beautiful Fall colors in the trees, to the bitter cold and white landscapes of winter, to the vibrant and reawakening Springs to the hot and humid summers. There should be storms, and ice, snow and all that goes with that like not being able to drive or slick sidewalks/pavement. There should be flash floods, and thunderstorms, mud puddles, etc during the Spring. Windy conditions during the Fall, intense heat and cloudless days during the summer. Unpredictable weather that can change during a day and plummet from extremely hot to cold during the Spring and Fall or go from bright sunshine to a massive thunderstorm during the summer.

# Day vs. Night

This is another big one to consider. Are you going to use the same exact buildings between the day and night world (in the beginning) but change the interiors completely? The idea is that the same city has two completely different set of residents between day – all human – and night, mostly monster. Are you instead going to have similar cities but the players transition between realities so the payer exists on normal Earth in the city during the day (albeit with tons of plots and twists and so forth to keep things engaging) and then they are forced to the monster reality of that city – which is completely different given the races that live there – at night?

In either case, the player being able to live in both versions of the city – and to transition human parts to the monster world and materials for drugs from the monster world – are key to the game. This means that there is a way to transition between the two versions. Are you using this transition to leak a monster into the human world or even give certain monster families (think crime syndicates or the mob) access on occasion to steal people? Are you leaking a monster over to the human world on occasion? Can human criminals (think cartels, gangs, mob) do the reverse and it is up to the player to stop any of these actions? How does this transition work and how do you equip the story teller with the ability to leverage these options?

# Facial Expressions

We have already put in Personality Models to aid in emotion to determine dialogue and actions but have you considered facial emotions? Humans are very sensitive to facial emotions and, combined with body language, we are heavily influenced by a person’s face and posture. A person can be standing in a hostile manner with a scowl and clenched teeth and say the same thing as a person in an open stance with a broad smile and a human would read hear that same sentence in an entirely different way.

# Voices

Are you going to support audio and, if so, have you worked through how different monsters will sound, how their personalities impact their voices and how you can ensure the voices do not sound like they came from an AI model? If there are sounds overall – and there should be outside of voices – then you need to think through the sounds literally everything makes. Buildings creak, cars rumble, cats meow, other creatures make other sounds, trees groan in heavy winds, there are a LOT of sounds.

On top of that, music can be an extremely powerful tool for setting the mood. That music can be eerie and barely audible, loud and high energy, used to emphasize a jump scare, when a person turns on a radio, etc. Some of the best games out there use music and sounds to a very large extent. I do not want constantly running soundtracks or anything as that is not realistic but using music effectively is important. In a city there are ALWAYS background noises – insects, vehicles, sirens, people talking in that way that you can’t real hear their words, plates and glasses clinking at a restaurant, etc.

# Immersive

Finally, remember that the game needs to be as immersive as possible and that means high end visualizations, great audio and using those to impact the other senses. Seeing a putrid pile of trash with flies all over it gives humans a visceral sense of stink. Having some night insect bite you and then seeing a welt and having the visuals and audio represent dizziness and/or slowness in processes the world literally makes a person feel dizzy or weak. Now be careful to not go too far here – we don’t want people vomiting! Queasy, sure!

Lighting

We need to ensure that everything in the game is playing with light and shadow. In the human world, we are talking bright sunshine, deep shadows, dark tunnels and under passes. Bright sparkling snow, vibrant meadows, sparkling creeks, deep blue waters, rainbows and lightening, etc.

In the Dark world we are talking about deep darkness, pools of light, bright bars, dimly lit back alleys, bright moonlight that goes black when a cloud passes overhead, shockingly bright spears of lightening. Beams of a flashlight or a dimly lit lap or a candle showing a small region of, perhaps, life saving light.

Textures

Textures are also very important. The glean of metal, the ancient look of old stones or castle walls, the polished look of a new car and the weathered look of an old wagon. The texture of wooden floors, shiny mosaic tiles, blood glistening on wicked blades. Textures play a prominent role in bringing things to life.

Obviously light plays a role here as well – making plastic look shiny and bumpy such as on a bounce castle or rigid and hard. Light highlights some materials and makes other look old and dull. Darkness adds shadows to provide depth and to hide objects that create visions of things that are not there.

Destruction and Creation

This is a living world and, as sch, things both good and bad grow over time. Thus we might have a young flower (or death vine) growing slowly over time. An explosion of beauty that drowns out the darkness only to disappear. Spring flowers blossoming, fresh water sparkling, etc.

We also are going to have destructions – building half destroyed or demolished, broken chairs and doors, old and moldy interiors, holes smashed through windows and walls. The story teller will need complete freedom to destroy and create at every level.

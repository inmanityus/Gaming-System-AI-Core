## 🏙️ STARTING LOCATION: VERIDIAN CITY

### Initial Scene: "The Waking Nightmare"

**Location**: Back alley of St. Jude's Mercy Hospital

## 💪 STARTING SKILLS

### Passive:

## 🧟 ARCHETYPE IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

### Current (Pilot):
1. ✅ **Vampire** (rich dialogue, social dynamics)
2. ✅ **Zombie** (scale testing, horde behaviors)

### Post-Pilot Sequence:

**Phase 3: Ghosts & Spirits** (Fundamental Dark World)
- **Varieties**: Hungry Ghosts (melee), Weeping Wraiths (AoE debuff), Poltergeists (environmental), Helpful Spirits (quest givers)
- **Dialogue**: Helpful Spirits YES, others ambient (moans, whispers)
- **Why First**: Introduces non-physical threats, Focus mechanic tutorial

**Phase 4: Undead Varieties** (Tactical Depth)
- **Ghouls**: Fast, crawling, wall-climbing, disease infliction
- **Skeletons**: Resistant to pierce/slash, weak to blunt
- **Wights**: Intelligent commanders, raise dead, use weapons

---

## 🗣️ DIALOGUE VS NON-SPEAKING

### **NEEDS DIALOGUE** (Gold-Tier NPCs):
- ✅ Fae (Good/Bad) - Wordplay, bargains, riddles essential
- ✅ Demons (Higher-ranking) - Bargaining, manipulation, temptation
- ✅ Helpful Spirits / Key Ghosts - Quest givers, guides
- ✅ Intelligent Undead - Wights, Vampires, Liches (leaders, masterminds)
- ✅ Future Civilized Races - Elves, Dwarves (societies)

### **AMBIENT / NON-SPEAKING** (Silver/Bronze-Tier):
- ✅ Most Undead - Zombies, Skeletons, Ghouls (groans, shrieks, hisses)
- ✅ Baser Ghosts - Hungry Ghosts, Poltergeists, Wraiths (environmental audio)
- ✅ Terrifying Monsters - Roars, clicks, alien sounds
- ✅ Demonic/Fae Beasts - Hellhounds, hounds (growls, howls)
- ✅ Goblins - Mostly guttural shrieks, leaders speak broken English

## 🔄 CROSS-WORLD SYNERGIES

### **Human → Dark World**:
- UV Flashbangs stagger undead
- Sonic Emitters disorient Hellhounds
- Modified cattle prods disrupt ethereal forms
- Silver-plated armor resists werewolves
- Money buys tech, weapon schematics, bribes
- Safehouse refines Raw Essence

### **Dark → Human World**:
- Essence fuels supernatural abilities
- Shadow-Veil Amulet = invisible to cameras
- Ectoplasmic Lens = see invisible security
- Demon Ichor/Fae Wings = sell for cash
- True Names = banish/command demons

## 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION IMPACT ON ARCHETYPE SYSTEM

### Current Architecture (7 Adapters Per Archetype):
1. personality
2. dialogue_style
3. action_policy
4. emotional_response
5. world_knowledge
6. social_dynamics
7. goal_prioritization

### Adjustments Needed:

**For Non-Speaking Creatures** (Zombies, Skeletons, basic Ghosts):
- **dialogue_style adapter**: Train on ambient sounds, moans, environmental audio
- **personality/social/goal adapters**: Simplified (hunger-driven, instinct-based)
- **Result**: Still 7 adapters, but some are minimal

**For Ambient/Environmental Creatures**:
- Can share base adapters across similar types
- Example: All "mindless undead" share base personality adapter
- Subfaction adapters for specific behaviors (skeleton vs ghoul movement)

**Resource Optimization**:
- **Gold-Tier** (dialogue required): 7 full adapters (~700MB each)
- **Silver-Tier** (limited dialogue): 7 adapters with shared bases (~400MB each)
- **Bronze-Tier** (ambient only): Shared adapters with minimal customization (~200MB each)

## 📊 TRAINING DATA REQUIREMENTS

### Immediate (Pilot Complete):
- ✅ Vampire: 1,785 examples
- ✅ Zombie: 686 examples

### Phase 3 (Ghosts):

### Phase 4 (Undead Varieties):

### Phase 5 (Lesser Fae):
- Estimated: 1,500-2,000 examples
- Critical: Riddles, wordplay, bargains, binding promises

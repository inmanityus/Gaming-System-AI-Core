## The Ancient Epochs

### The First Darkness (Epoch of Formation)
No one truly knows when the Dark World came into being, but all races agree on one thing: it existed long before humanity even learned to make fire. During this primordial age, reality itself was still settling into its final forms. The boundaries between dimensions were thin, and entities from other planes occasionally bled through—some stayed, some left, but all left their mark.

**What the Story Teller Should Know:**
- This epoch lasted for thousands of millennia (exact timeline intentionally vague)
- Multiple "waves" of otherworldly entities arrived during this time
- These entities became the ancestors of current Dark World races
- Ancient conflicts shaped the landscape itself (hence the jagged terrain, floating ruins, and areas where physics don't quite work right)
- **Fill In**: Specific arrival dates, names of the first entities, details of the earliest conflicts—use player backstory to inform these

### The Age of Divisions (The First Splintering)
As the primordial chaos settled, the first true civilizations emerged. This wasn't a single empire, but rather a network of city-states and territories carved out by the most powerful of the early entities. These beings were far more powerful than anything that exists today, but their conflicts eventually tore them apart.

**Major Event: The Shattering**
A catastrophic event (the exact nature lost to time—was it a war? A magical experiment gone wrong? An invasion from another dimension?) caused a massive schism. Reality itself cracked, creating permanent rifts and unstable zones throughout the Dark World. Many of the most powerful entities vanished or were sealed away.

**Story Teller Notes:**
- Some of these sealed entities might be discovered (or accidentally released) by players
- The unstable zones can be used for unique locations, quests, or environmental hazards
- References to "the time before the Shattering" can add mystery to ancient ruins or artifacts

### The Age of Consolidation (Building Empires)
After the Shattering, the surviving races regrouped and began building what would become the modern Dark World. This period saw the rise of the first major houses, the establishment of magical traditions, and the creation of the political structures that still exist today.

**Timeline**: Approximately 15,000-8,000 years ago (rough estimate—records are incomplete)

**Key Developments:**
- First established houses form among vampires, werewolves, and other long-lived races
- Magical guilds begin organizing and codifying their practices
- Trade routes and territories are established
- The first laws governing inter-racial interactions are created

## The Great Races

### Vampires (The Blood Court)
**Origins**: Unknown, but believed to be descended from one of the first waves of entities from another dimension. They've existed for at least 12,000 years in their current form.

### Zombies and Ghouls (The Hungering Masses)
**Origins**: Result of dark magic experiments gone wrong, plagues, curses, or deliberate creation—depends on the strain. Multiple origins mean they're not a unified race.

**Characteristics**:

**Story Teller Fill-In**: Specific strains and their origins, territories controlled by intelligent undead, how they interact with living races, special abilities

### Liches (The Immortal Scholars)
**Origins**: Beings who achieved immortality through forbidden magical rituals. Each lich is unique—there's no single method, just desperate beings who found ways to avoid death.

- Live in isolated strongholds
- Form occasional alliances but mostly work alone
- Some have apprentices, some have legions of undead

**Notable Liches** (Story Teller can add more):

### Other Races
**The Fae-Touched**: Entities with connection to primal nature magic. Include various types of fey, changelings, and nature spirits. Highly territorial and follow ancient pacts.

**The Shadowkin**: Humanoid entities made of living shadow. Rare, mysterious, often serve as assassins or spies for the highest bidders.

**The Wraith Lords**: Non-corporeal entities that can possess objects or bodies. Once mortal, now bound to the Dark World through curses or broken oaths.

**The Bone Constructs**: Animated remains of fallen empires, created by ancient magic. Some are mindless guardians, some have achieved true sentience.

**Story Teller Fill-In**: Create additional races as needed. Mix and match characteristics. Each race should have at least one major faction or organization.

## Major Houses and Families

The Dark World is ruled by ancient bloodlines and established houses. These aren't just families—they're political entities, economic powers, and sometimes armies.

### House Politics
All major races have house systems, though they work differently:
- **Vampires**: Rigid hierarchies, bloodline obsessions, arranged marriages for power
- **Werewolves**: Pack-based, alpha leadership, territorial claims
- **Liches**: Independent but form temporary councils when needed
- **Others**: Varies by race

### Inter-House Conflicts

- **The Pack Schism** (1,500 years ago): Split werewolf packs into urban vs. wild factions
- **The Lich Purge** (800 years ago): Houses united to destroy a lich who threatened all of them

**Story Teller Fill-In**: Current house conflicts, alliances, betrayals, succession crises, territorial disputes, business rivalries

### Family Feuds
Beyond the major houses, smaller families constantly feud over:
- Territory
- Resources
- Old grudges
- Business interests
- Magical artifacts
- Bloodline purity

2. **House Politics**: Player gets involved in current house conflicts—who to side with? What happens when houses fall?

3. **Lost Empires**: Player finds ruins from fallen empires—what artifacts remain? What dangers? What knowledge?

4. **Guild Conflicts**: Player joins a guild or conflicts with one—what are their real goals? What secrets do they hide?

5. **Magical Discoveries**: Player uncovers new magical techniques or rediscover lost ones—how do existing powers react?

6. **Inter-Dimensional Threats**: Signs of new dimensional rifts or entities—is history repeating? Can it be stopped?

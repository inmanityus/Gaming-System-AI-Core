## 💀 THE PREMISE

**You are not a survivor. You are The Body Broker.**

Kill humans. Harvest their parts. Sell to Dark World monsters. Get paid in drugs. Build empires in both worlds.

"Forget the reluctant survivor. Forget being a hero. We are building a monster. A king." - Story Teller

## 🔄 CORE GAMEPLAY LOOP: "Harvest & Haggle"

### Stage 1: The Order (Shopping List)
**Location**: The Abattoir (Dark World marketplace)

**How It Works**:
- Receive orders from Dark World clients
- Low-tier: "50kg raw flesh, any quality" (public bounty)
- High-tier: "One O-negative athletic female, heart pre-mortem" (private encrypted request)
- Orders dictate Human World targets

### Stage 2: The Hunt (Acquisition)
**Location**: Human World

**Method Matters**:
- ❌ **Shotgun blast**: Fast but ruins organs → "Junk" quality
- ✅ **Blade/poison**: Quiet, preserves parts → "Good" quality
- ✅✅ **Live extraction**: Difficult but best → "Prime/Pristine" quality

**Targets**:
- Surgeon path: Criminals, traffickers, abusers
- Butcher path: Anyone (hospitals, schools, suburbs)

### Stage 3: The Harvest (Processing)
**Location**: Workshop (upgradable: ambulance → club backroom → corporate lab)

**Mechanics**:
- Tense skill-based mini-game
- **Timer**: Decay (body parts have shelf life)
- **Tools matter**: Rusty hacksaw vs surgical laser
- **Skill matters**: Botch = worthless mush, Success = "Pristine" quality

### Stage 4: The Haggle (The Sale)
**Location**: Dark World client meetings

**Mechanics**:
- Dialogue-based negotiation
- Factors: Reputation, quality, understanding client personality
- **Fail low-tier**: They might attack/eat you
- **Fail high-tier**: Blacklisted OR bounty on YOUR head

## 🎭 MORAL CHOICE SYSTEM

### The Surgeon (Selective Killing):
✅ Only criminals, abusers, deserving targets  
❌ Slower growth, limited supply  
✅ Vigilante respect in Human World  
❌ "Finicky" reputation in Dark  
⚠️ Fae constantly test your rules

### The Butcher (Kill Anyone):
✅ Fast growth, fulfill any order  
✅ Best Dark World reputation  
❌ Public Enemy #1 in Human World  
❌ Universally reviled, everyone wants you dead  
⚠️ Risk unleashing horrors

### The Test:
- Fae will offer impossible choices
- High-tier clients demand innocents
- Your crew might refuse evil orders (or embrace them)
- Every choice has cascading consequences

---

## 🔑 RESONANT BLOODLINE (Player's Secret)

**Discovery**: Someone tried to harvest YOU

**Revelation**: Your body/essence is "Exquisite" quality - desired by highest tiers

**Consequence**: 
- As you use Dark drugs, your bloodline becomes MORE potent
- You become MORE valuable to your own clients
- Constant threat: They might try to harvest you
- **Ultimate Goal**: Become so powerful no one CAN harvest you

**Storyline**: This is your personal arc - from product to Broker to untouchable power

---

## 🎮 PLAYER ARCHETYPES (Redesigned)

### **S-TIER: The Face/Diplomat** (Most Important)
- Negotiation, haggling, lying, charm, intimidation
- CRITICAL for Dark World dealings
- Low Charisma = eaten, betrayed, broke
- **This IS The Broker**

### **A-TIER: The Infiltrator/Surgeon**
- Stealth, precision kills, clean extraction
- Quality determines payment
- Difference between success and failure

### **A-TIER: The Chemist/Alchemist**
- Master Dark World drugs
- Mix, enhance, resist effects
- Turn Moon-Wine into controlled stim
- Process Vitae into mind-control agent
- Weaponize profits

### **B-TIER: The Brute/Enforcer**
- Combat for Human empire
- When deals go bad
- Tool, not primary identity
- You employ brutes, you don't become one

---

## 🌍 WORLD INTERACTION UPDATES

### Corporate Knowledge:
- ❌ DON'T know full Dark World exists
- ✅ HAVE dead Dark specimens (research)
- ✅ MIGHT have live specimens (rare)
- ❌ DON'T work with ancient families (yet)
- ⚠️ Enough evidence to be dangerous, not enough to understand

### Fae Rules (Binding):
- ✅ **NEVER lie** (but master misdirection)
- ✅ **NEVER reveal to humans** in Light World
- ✅ Cause chaos for entertainment
- ✅ Binding promises (be VERY careful)

### Enhancement Mechanics:
- **Physical armor**: Works in Human, useless in Dark (magic penetrates)
- **Fire spells**: Work in Dark, unpredictable in Human (might fail OR blow up city block)
- **Mixed enhancements**: Sometimes work both, can fail catastrophically
- **Risk**: Using wrong power in wrong world = death

## 🎯 HOW THIS CHANGES ARCHETYPE SYSTEM

### NPC Archetypes Now Need:

**Negotiation AI** (NEW - Critical):
- Price haggling

**Client Personality Systems**:
- Each Dark family has unique personality
- Vampires: Formal, hierarchical
- Ghouls: Aggressive, hungry
- Fae: Riddling, binding promises
- Golems: Cold, logical

**Morality Reaction System**:
- NPCs react differently to Surgeon vs Butcher
- Some refuse to work with Butcher
- Some exploit Surgeon's "weakness"
- Dynamic reputation system

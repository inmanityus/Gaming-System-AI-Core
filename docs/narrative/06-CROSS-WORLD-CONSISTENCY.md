# Cross-World Consistency System
**Purpose**: Ensure lore consistency across all player worlds while allowing narrative flexibility  
**Status**: Mandatory requirement for Story Teller system

---

## Core Principle

**Lore is shared, stories are unique.**

The foundational history, major characters, organizations, and world structure are consistent across all player worlds. However, how these elements manifest, what actions occur, and what stories emerge are unique to each player's world.

---

## What Must Be Consistent Across Worlds

### 1. Historical Lore
**MANDATORY CONSISTENCY**
- All major historical events happened the same way
- Historical timelines are identical
- Fallen empires, calamities, and major conflicts are the same
- Lost knowledge, artifacts, and dead languages are consistent
- Major historical figures existed the same way

**Example**: The Shattering happened in all worlds, the Blood Plague affected all worlds the same way, the Dimensional Invasion occurred in all worlds.

**Story Teller Rule**: Never change major historical events. These are fixed. However, you can reveal them gradually, and players can discover different aspects of them.

### 2. Major Races and Their Characteristics
**MANDATORY CONSISTENCY**
- All major races exist in all worlds (Vampires, Werewolves, Liches, etc.)
- Core characteristics of each race are consistent
- Major houses/factions within races exist (House Crimson, The Iron Claw Pack, etc.)
- Racial abilities, weaknesses, and cultural traits are consistent

**Example**: House Crimson exists in all worlds as the oldest vampire house. The Iron Claw Pack exists in all worlds as the largest urban werewolf pack.

**Story Teller Rule**: If you create a new house or pack, it must be added to the shared lore and appear in all worlds (though its status and actions can vary).

### 3. Major Organizations and Guilds
**MANDATORY CONSISTENCY**
- Major guilds exist in all worlds (Merchant Consortium, Assassins' Guild, etc.)
- Core purpose and structure of guilds are consistent
- Major crime organizations exist in all worlds (The Syndicate, major Cartels, etc.)
- Government structures are similar (though specific leaders can differ)

**Example**: The Merchant Consortium exists in all worlds as a trade organization. The Syndicate exists in all worlds as the oldest crime organization.

**Story Teller Rule**: If you create a new major organization, it becomes part of shared lore and exists in all worlds (though its power, actions, and relationships can vary).

### 4. Major Bosses and Faction Leaders
**MANDATORY CONSISTENCY**
- Major bosses are the same characters across all worlds
- Their core characteristics, appearance, and background are consistent
- Their position and power level are similar
- Their relationships with other major characters are consistent

**Example**: The leader of House Crimson (specific name TBD by Story Teller, but once named, consistent across worlds), the Alpha of The Iron Claw Pack, the head of The Syndicate—these are the same people in all worlds.

**Story Teller Rule**: 
- Major bosses have consistent names, appearances, and core traits
- Their actions can differ based on world state and player interactions
- Their motivations can be revealed differently, but core motivations are consistent
- They can be in different situations, but they're the same people

### 5. Geographic and World Structure
**MANDATORY CONSISTENCY**
- Major cities exist in all worlds (though specific details can vary)
- Regional geography is consistent
- Major locations (breach points, important landmarks) exist in all worlds
- The relationship between Light and Dark worlds is consistent

**Example**: The starting city exists in all worlds (though neighborhoods, NPCs, and current events can differ). Major breach points exist in all worlds (though their status can vary).

**Story Teller Rule**: Major locations are fixed. Specific buildings, neighborhoods, and local NPCs can differ.

### 6. Magical Systems and Rules
**MANDATORY CONSISTENCY**
- How magic works is consistent
- Magical traditions exist in all worlds
- Rules and limitations of magic are the same
- How the worlds connect is consistent

**Example**: Blood magic requires blood, lunar magic is tied to moon phases, shadow magic requires shadows—these rules are the same in all worlds.

**Story Teller Rule**: Magic rules are fixed. How magic is used and who uses it can vary.

## What Can Vary Between Worlds

### 1. Major Boss Actions and Situations
**ALLOWED VARIATION**
- What major bosses are currently doing can differ
- Their relationships with players can differ
- Their current problems and goals can differ
- Whether they're winning or losing can differ

**Example**: 
- In World A: House Crimson leader is preparing for war
- In World B: House Crimson leader is negotiating peace
- In World C: House Crimson leader is dealing with internal rebellion
- **But it's the same person in all worlds**

**Story Teller Rule**: Major bosses can have different current situations and actions, but they're consistent characters with consistent core traits.

### 2. Minor NPCs
**FREE VARIATION**
- Most NPCs are unique to each world
- Their names, backgrounds, and stories can be different
- They don't need to exist in other worlds
- Story Teller has full creative freedom

**Example**: A bartender in World A might not exist in World B. A street vendor in World C might have a completely different background in World D.

**Story Teller Rule**: Create NPCs freely for each world. Only popular NPCs (see below) become consistent.

### 3. Current Events
**FREE VARIATION**
- What's happening right now can differ
- Current conflicts can differ
- Ongoing problems can differ
- World state can differ

**Example**:
- World A: Cartel war is heating up
- World B: Cartel war just ended
- World C: No cartel war, but corporate conflict is escalating

**Story Teller Rule**: Current events are unique to each world, though they draw from the same pool of possible conflicts and situations.

### 4. Player-Specific Content
**FREE VARIATION**
- How major elements relate to the player is unique
- Player's backstory and connections are unique
- Player's reputation and relationships are unique
- Player's choices and consequences are unique

**Example**: In World A, player might be an enemy of House Crimson. In World B, player might be an ally. Same house, different relationship.

**Story Teller Rule**: Player interactions are always unique to that player's world.

## Popular NPC Promotion System

### When an NPC Becomes Popular

**Engagement Threshold**:
- High player interaction frequency
- Extended conversation sessions
- Player-initiated interactions (seeking out the NPC)
- Positive or negative strong reactions (love or hate)
- Player references to NPC in feedback or discussions
- NPC appears in multiple player quests or story threads

**Measurement**: System tracks:
- Number of interactions
- Duration of interactions
- Player-initiated vs. Story Teller-initiated
- Player sentiment (positive/negative engagement)
- Story relevance (how central to player's story)

### Promotion Process

**Step 1: Identification**
- System flags NPC as potentially popular based on engagement metrics
- Story Teller reviews and confirms popularity
- NPC is marked for promotion if threshold met

**Step 2: Lore Integration**
- NPC's core characteristics are extracted (name, appearance, personality, background)
- NPC is added to shared lore database
- Core traits are made consistent across worlds

**Step 3: Cross-World Deployment**
- NPC appears in other player worlds (with consistent core traits)
- Actions and situation can differ based on world state
- Story Teller adapts NPC to fit each world's context

**Step 4: Ongoing Consistency**
- Once promoted, NPC maintains consistency across worlds
- Core characteristics remain fixed
- Actions and situations can vary
- Player relationships can vary

### Popular NPC Examples

**Scenario 1: Quirky Shopkeeper**
- Player A has frequent interactions with eccentric shopkeeper "Old Man Marcus"
- Player loves the character, seeks out interactions, references in feedback
- **Promotion**: Marcus becomes consistent character, appears in all worlds
- **Variation**: In World B, Marcus might have a different shop location, different inventory, different current problem, but same personality and core traits

**Scenario 2: Rival Character**
- Player B has strong negative engagement with rival "Shadow"
- Player actively seeks confrontations, talks about the character
- **Promotion**: Shadow becomes consistent character, appears in all worlds
- **Variation**: In World A, Shadow might be a different type of threat, have different goals, but same core personality and relationship dynamic

**Scenario 3: Mentor Figure**
- Player C has extended sessions with mentor "Elena the Wise"
- Player frequently seeks advice, references the character's wisdom
- **Promotion**: Elena becomes consistent character, appears in all worlds
- **Variation**: In World D, Elena might have different knowledge, different current mission, but same wisdom and mentoring style

### Popular NPC Guidelines

**Core Traits (Fixed)**:
- Name
- Appearance (basic description)
- Core personality
- Basic background
- Role/function

**Variable Elements**:
- Current situation
- Specific goals
- Relationships with other NPCs
- Player relationship
- Current problems
- Exact dialogue and actions

**Story Teller Rule**: Once an NPC is promoted, maintain core consistency while allowing narrative flexibility.

## Major Bosses - Definition and List

### Definition of "Major Boss"

**Major bosses are**:
- Leaders of major houses (Vampire house leaders)
- Leaders of major packs (Werewolf pack alphas)
- Leaders of major organizations (Guild masters, crime bosses)
- Powerful independent entities (Ancient liches, major players)
- Cross-world significant figures (Key political leaders, major power brokers)

**Criteria**:
- Have significant power or influence
- Control resources, territory, or people
- Are known across multiple regions or worlds
- Are central to major conflicts or storylines

### Major Boss Consistency Rules

**1. Identity Consistency**:
- Same name across all worlds
- Same appearance (core description)
- Same background and history
- Same power level and capabilities
- Same core personality traits

**2. Position Consistency**:
- Same leadership role
- Same organization/house/pack affiliation
- Similar power and influence level
- Similar relationship with other major bosses

**3. Action Variation Allowed**:
- Current goals can differ
- Current problems can differ
- Actions in response to player can differ
- Current alliances and conflicts can differ
- Specific dialogue and interactions can differ

**Example: "Marcus Blackwood" (Leader of House Crimson)**
- **Consistent**: Name, appearance, position, power, core personality, relationships with other houses
- **Variable**: Current actions, goals, problems, relationship with player, specific dialogue

### Major Boss List (To Be Defined by Story Teller)

As the Story Teller creates major bosses, they should be documented in a shared database:

**Template**:
```
BOSS NAME: [Name]
ROLE: [Leader of House/Pack/Organization]
APPEARANCE: [Core description]
PERSONALITY: [Core traits]
POWER LEVEL: [Scale 1-10]
RELATIONSHIPS: [Key relationships with other major bosses]
BACKGROUND: [Key historical background]
VARIABLE ELEMENTS: [What can differ between worlds]
```

**Story Teller Rule**: When creating a major boss, document core traits immediately. These become fixed across all worlds.

## Story Teller Implementation Guidelines

### When Creating New Content

**Ask**: "Is this lore or story?"
- **Lore** = Must be consistent across worlds
- **Story** = Can be unique to each world

**Lore Examples**:
- Creating a new major house → Must be consistent
- Creating a new major guild → Must be consistent
- Defining a new historical event → Must be consistent
- Creating a major boss → Must be consistent

**Story Examples**:
- Creating a minor NPC → Can be unique
- Developing current events → Can be unique
- Creating player-specific quests → Can be unique
- Developing local conflicts → Can be unique

### When Adapting Existing Content

**Major Elements**:
- Maintain core consistency
- Adapt actions and situations
- Allow world-specific variations
- Keep core relationships consistent

**Minor Elements**:
- Full creative freedom
- No consistency required
- Can be completely different

### Cross-World Database

**Maintain Shared Lore Database**:
- Historical events (fixed)
- Major races and houses (fixed)
- Major organizations (fixed)
- Major bosses (core traits fixed)
- Popular NPCs (core traits fixed)
- Geographic structure (major locations fixed)

**Story Teller Rule**: Update shared database whenever creating major lore elements or promoting NPCs.

## Examples

### Example 1: Creating a New House

**Action**: Story Teller creates "House Vermillion" as a new vampire house in World A

**Process**:
1. Define core traits: Name, founding, characteristics, territory
2. Add to shared lore database
3. House Vermillion now exists in ALL worlds
4. In World B, House Vermillion might have different current status, different problems, different relationships, but same core traits

**Result**: Consistent lore, variable story

### Example 2: Popular NPC Promotion

**Action**: NPC "Jinx" becomes popular in World A

**Process**:
1. Extract core traits: Name, appearance, personality, role
2. Add to shared lore database as popular NPC
3. Jinx now appears in ALL worlds
4. In World B, Jinx might have different current situation, different relationship with player, different specific actions, but same core personality

**Result**: Consistent character, variable interactions

### Example 3: Major Boss Action

**Action**: Major boss "Alpha Morgan" (Iron Claw Pack) attacks player in World A

**Process**:
1. Core traits remain consistent (same person, same power, same pack)
2. Action is unique to World A (maybe player provoked attack)
3. In World B, Alpha Morgan might help player (different situation)
4. In World C, Alpha Morgan might be neutral (different context)

**Result**: Consistent character, variable actions

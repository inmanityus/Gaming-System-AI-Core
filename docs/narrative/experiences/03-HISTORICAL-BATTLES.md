**NPC Army Management**
```cpp
class ABattleArmy : public AActor
{
    UPROPERTY()
    TArray<ANPCSoldier*> Units;
    
    UPROPERTY()
    FBattleFormation CurrentFormation;
    
    void ExecuteCommand(EArmyCommand Command)
    {
        switch (Command)
        {
            case EArmyCommand::Advance:
                MoveFormation(ForwardVector);
                break;
            case EArmyCommand::HoldPosition:
                SetFormationStance(EStance::Defensive);
                break;
            case EArmyCommand::Retreat:
                MoveFormation(-ForwardVector);
                break;
            case EArmyCommand::FireAtWill:
                EngageNearestEnemies();
                break;
        }
    }
};
```

**Historical Weapon Systems**
```cpp
USTRUCT()
struct FHistoricalWeapon
{
    UPROPERTY()
    EWeaponEra Era;
    
    UPROPERTY()
    float ReloadTime; // Authentic timing
    
    UPROPERTY()
    float EffectiveRange;
    
    UPROPERTY()
    int32 AmmoCapacity;
    
    UPROPERTY()
    bool bRequiresMelee; // Bayonet, etc.
};
```

## The Starting City

## Narrative Hooks for Story Teller

1. **Starting Point**: Player begins with nothing—what first opportunity presents itself?

2. **The Discovery**: Player discovers they can cross worlds—how? When? What happens?

3. **The First Deal**: Player makes their first body broker deal—with who? What goes wrong (or right)?

4. **The Escalation**: Player's activities attract attention—who notices? What do they want?

5. **The Expansion**: Player wants to grow—what opportunities exist? What obstacles?

6. **The Major Conflict**: Something big happens—how does player get involved? What role do they play?

7. **The Consequences**: Player's actions have effects—how does the world react? What changes?

**Remember**: The current world state is a foundation. The Story Teller should use this as a starting point, then evolve everything based on player actions. Nothing is set in stone—everything can change based on what players do.

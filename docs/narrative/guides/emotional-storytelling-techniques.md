## The Neuroscience of Emotion

### How Emotions Work in Storytelling

**Mirror Neurons**:
- Readers/viewers experience emotions characters feel
- Brain simulates experiences
- "Feeling with" characters

**Emotional Contagion**:
- Emotions spread through narrative
- Describing emotions evokes them
- Physical sensations trigger empathy

**Memory Formation**:
- Emotional moments encoded stronger
- Amygdala activation during emotional scenes
- Why we remember emotional stories

**Limbic System Activation**:
- Stories bypass rational brain
- Direct emotional impact
- Why stories persuade better than facts

### Key Principles

**Show, Don't Tell**:
- Don't say "She was scared"
- Show physical reactions: "Her hands trembled as she reached for the doorknob"
- Reader experiences with character

**Sensory Details**:
- Engage all five senses
- Specific details > general descriptions
- Ground reader in scene

**Visceral Language**:
- Physical metaphors
- "Gut-wrenching", "heart-pounding"
- Body experiences emotions

**Character Vulnerability**:
- Readers connect through vulnerability
- Perfect characters don't evoke emotion
- Flaws make characters human

- Door slowly opening
- Footsteps approaching

```

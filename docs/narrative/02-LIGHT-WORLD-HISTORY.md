## The Human World

The Light World is our reality—or close to it. This is the world humans know, the world where they live their daily lives, unaware that just beyond the veil exists an entire other reality populated by monsters and supernatural beings. But the Dark World's influence, subtle though it may be, has shaped human history in ways they don't understand.

**Key Characteristics**:
- More violent and chaotic than our real world
- Organized crime is a dominant force in many regions
- Class systems are rigid and brutal
- Law enforcement is limited and often corrupt
- Dark World influences exist as myths, legends, and unexplained phenomena

**Story Teller Notes**: This world should feel familiar but darker, more dangerous. Players start at the bottom of the social ladder and must claw their way up through violence, crime, or cunning.

## Historical Epochs

### The Ancient Foundations (Pre-Recorded History)
Humans have existed for tens of thousands of years, building civilizations that rose and fell. Early humans built great cities, created art, developed agriculture, and fought wars. But they also experienced things they couldn't explain—disappearances in the night, creatures that shouldn't exist, strange lights in the darkness.

**What Humans Don't Know**: Many of these "myths" were real encounters with the Dark World. Some disappearances were kidnappings. Some monsters were real entities bleeding through the veil. Ancient humans developed superstitions, religions, and protections based on these encounters, even though they didn't understand what they were protecting themselves against.

**Story Teller Fill-In**: Specific ancient civilizations (can be based on real history but twisted darker), what encounters with Dark World happened, what protections were developed, what knowledge was lost

### The Age of Empires (5,000-2,000 years ago)
Great empires rose and fell across the globe. These weren't peaceful periods—conquest, slavery, and brutal warfare were the norm. But these empires also left behind structures, laws, and cultural traditions that still influence the modern world.

**Major Developments**:
- Large-scale organized warfare
- Trade networks spanning continents
- Written laws and legal systems (however brutal)
- Class structures that still exist today
- First major organized crime groups (smuggling, protection rackets, assassination guilds)

**What Humans Don't Know**: Some of the great disasters that destroyed these empires weren't natural—they were caused by Dark World entities testing the boundaries, or by attempts to breach the veil. Some "miracles" were actually magical interventions from the other side.

**Story Teller Fill-In**: Specific empires (based on real history but darker), how they fell, what role Dark World might have played, what artifacts or knowledge remain

### The Age of Discovery and Colonization (1,500-500 years ago)
Humans explored the globe, colonized new lands, and expanded their reach. This was an age of exploitation, slavery, and brutal subjugation of indigenous peoples. It was also when organized crime truly began to take modern forms.

**Major Developments**:
- Global trade networks
- Large-scale organized smuggling
- Pirate organizations (early cartels)
- Mercenary companies (proto-mafias)
- First true crime families

**What Humans Don't Know**: Some "savages" encountered in new lands weren't human—they were remnants of races that had crossed over long ago or human-Dark World hybrids. Some of the "curses" that affected explorers were real magical effects.

**Story Teller Fill-In**: Specific expeditions, what was really encountered, what groups formed during this period, how they evolved into modern crime organizations

### The Industrial Revolution (300-100 years ago)
Technology advanced rapidly, cities grew, and power structures shifted. This was when modern organized crime truly emerged—the mobs, the gangs, the cartels that still dominate today.

**Major Developments**:
- Rapid urbanization
- Industrial capitalism (brutal exploitation)
- Formation of modern nation-states
- Rise of organized crime families
- Police forces (often corrupt from the start)

**What Humans Don't Know**: Some of the "industrial accidents" that killed hundreds were actually cover-ups for Dark World experiments or conflicts that spilled over. Some factories were built on sites of old breaches between worlds.

**Story Teller Fill-In**: Specific industrial disasters (can be based on real ones but add Dark World elements), how crime families formed, what territories they controlled, how they evolved

### The Modern Age (Last 100 years)
The world has become more connected, more violent, and more controlled by criminal organizations. Technology has advanced, but social structures have become more rigid. The gap between rich and poor has widened. Law enforcement is outmatched and often compromised.

**Current State**: Organized crime controls major portions of the economy. Cartels, gangs, and syndicates operate with near-impunity in many areas. Law enforcement is underfunded, corrupt, or simply unable to keep up. Class systems keep most people trapped at the bottom.

**What Humans Don't Know**: The recent increase in unexplained disappearances, strange phenomena, and "urban legends" are actually signs that the veil between worlds is thinning. Some crime organizations have unknowingly made deals with Dark World entities.

**Story Teller Fill-In**: Current events, how the world is divided, what major conflicts are happening, what role players will play

**Story Teller Fill-In**: Create specific cultures, mix and match characteristics, add regional details, cultural conflicts, how different cultures interact

### Races of Humanity

Humans in this world aren't all the same. Different populations have developed distinct characteristics over millennia.

**Note**: These differences are cultural, biological (to a degree), and social—not meant to reflect real-world prejudices, but rather to create game diversity.

**The Builders**: Large, strong, good at physical labor. Often found in industrial areas, construction, heavy crime. Started from populations that adapted to harsh physical environments.

**The Traders**: Quick, clever, good at negotiation and business. Often found in port cities, market districts, smuggling operations. Descended from populations that lived along trade routes.

**The Watchers**: Observant, patient, good at noticing details. Often found in law enforcement (corrupt or not), private investigation, information trading. Descended from populations that needed to watch for danger.

**The Wanderers**: Adaptable, resourceful, good at surviving anywhere. Often found in border regions, nomadic groups, people who cross between worlds. Mixed heritage, no fixed home.

**The Hidden**: Small, fast, good at staying unnoticed. Often found in stealth operations, smuggling, hiding. Descended from populations that needed to remain undetected.

**Story Teller Fill-In**: Create additional races or sub-races, specific benefits and drawbacks, how they interact, where they're found, what stereotypes exist

**Player Note**: Players can be any combination—maybe mixed heritage explains their ability to cross worlds.

## Dark World Influences

Humans don't know about the Dark World, but they've been influenced by it for millennia. These influences appear as myths, legends, superstitions, and unexplained phenomena.

### The Myths
**Vampires**: Stories about blood-drinking creatures that live in darkness
- **Reality**: Based on real encounters, but humans don't know they're still active
- **Story Teller Use**: Players might use these myths to their advantage, or discover they're true

**Werewolves**: Stories about people who turn into wolves
- **Reality**: Real creatures, occasionally seen
- **Story Teller Use**: Some "animal attacks" are actually werewolves, players might encounter evidence

**Zombies/Ghouls**: Stories about the walking dead

- **Story Teller Use**: Players might see them, or find evidence, or use these myths for cover stories

**Demons/Spirits**: Stories about supernatural entities
- **Reality**: Various Dark World entities that have crossed over
- **Story Teller Use**: Unexplained phenomena, players might encounter real entities

### The Legends
Various urban legends and folktales are actually based on real Dark World events or entities:
- Disappearances that were actual kidnappings
- Cursed locations that are actually breach points
- Miracles that were actually magical interventions
- Curses that are actually real magical effects

**Story Teller Fill-In**: Create specific legends, determine which are real and which are just stories, use them to create quests or plot hooks

### The Superstitions
Humans have developed countless superstitions to protect themselves from things they don't understand:
- Wards against evil (some actually work against Dark World entities)
- Rituals for protection (some have real effects)
- Taboos about certain places or times (based on real dangers)

**Story Teller Fill-In**: Some superstitions work, some don't, players might learn which ones are real

### The Unexplained
Modern "unexplained phenomena" are often Dark World related:
- Mass disappearances (kidnappings)
- Strange creatures seen (actual entities)
- Mysterious deaths (Dark World violence)
- Cursed locations (breach points or sealed areas)

**Story Teller Use**: Create specific unexplained events, use them as quest hooks, reveal their true nature gradually

## The Modern Era

The Light World today is a place of:
- Massive inequality
- Organized crime dominance
- Corrupt or powerless law enforcement
- Constant violence and danger
- Opportunities for those bold enough
- Mysteries that no one understands

**The Starting City**: 
Players begin in a city that embodies all of this—crime-ridden, corrupt, dangerous, but full of opportunity. The exact city can vary, but it should be:
- Large enough to have organized crime presence
- Connected enough to have trade and smuggling
- Dangerous enough to justify the game's mechanics
- Diverse enough to support various storylines

**Story Teller Fill-In**: Create the specific starting city, its layout, its neighborhoods, its crime organizations, its secrets, its connection to the Dark World

## Narrative Hooks for Story Teller

1. **Starting at the Bottom**: Player begins with nothing—how do they survive? What opportunities present themselves?

2. **Climbing the Ladder**: Player wants power—what paths are available? Crime? Politics? Both?

3. **The Myths Are Real**: Player discovers Dark World entities are real—how do they react? Use it? Fight it? Join it?

4. **Cartel Wars**: Major conflict breaks out—which side does player choose? Or do they play both sides?

5. **Corrupt Cops**: Player encounters police—are they corrupt? Honest? How to deal with them?

6. **Class Conflict**: Social unrest breaks out—does player participate? Exploit? Prevent?

7. **The Unexplained**: Strange events happen—what's really going on? Is it Dark World related? How can player use it?

**Remember**: The Light World provides the foundation for player stories. It's dark, dangerous, and full of opportunity. Players can be heroes, villains, or something in between—it's all about their choices and how the Story Teller adapts the world to those choices.

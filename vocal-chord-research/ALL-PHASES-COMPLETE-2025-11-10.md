## 🎨 STORY TELLER FEEDBACK

**Phase 2B Validation** (GPT-4o as Story Teller):
- ✅ Dynamic chaos intensity: "Brilliant adjustment, reinforces unpredictability"
- ✅ Transformation struggle: "Exciting element, metaphor for internal conflict"
- ✅ Subliminal layers: "Excellent, adds subconscious unease"

**Phase 2C Suggestions** (Future):
- Interactive environment feedback (creaking floors, whispering shadows)
- Emotional resonance layers (minor key shifts based on player health)
- Infection signatures (unique audio per enemy type/rank)

## 🔬 PEER REVIEW SESSIONS

### Models Consulted (3 total)
1. **GPT-4o** (OpenRouter) - Lock-free concurrency, Story Teller validation
2. **Gemini 2.5 Flash** (OpenRouter) - Real-time audio DSP patterns
3. **Story Teller GPT-4o** - Creative validation + Phase 2C direction

### Critical Insights
- Sequential consistency required for multi-field struct atomicity
- Dynamic intensity exponentially scales with proximity
- Environmental factors modulate texture authentically
- Subliminal layers must be <5% signal for barely perceptible effect
- Transformation struggle uses random surges with exponential decay
